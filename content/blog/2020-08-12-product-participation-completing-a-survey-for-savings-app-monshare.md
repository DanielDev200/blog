[Monshare](https://monshare.io/) is an expense tracker for couples and groups. Being that I am one half of a couple and I like money, I agreed to complete a user research survey they put out. (Click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0EYjJSQI2-QXD_o15pvNaCuZ0NZIFNfBMfwFg74omSizzqA/viewform) if you also like money and are interested in answering questions for them.)

I took away two main points from the survey. One, is that Google Forms seems to be a go-to tool for surveys. Other surveys I have done in the past used it as well, so seeing it again here somewhat cements that it's an important tool for enabling user research. Duly noted.

The second is that while Monshare's survey overall seemed put together well, it seems to make a big assumption that discussing finances with a  partner is inherently stressful. The image is below is taken from the survey.

For me, discussing finances with my partner is not stressful, which I think Monshare might want to know before segmenting my data. I fear that without that key piece of information they could make incorrect assumptions as to the problems I experience in financial planning and how to solve them.
