If there is a poster child for modern technical education, I might be it. I became a web developer after attending a bootcamp, and now I'll be moving into product management with a Product Management Certificate (PMC) from Product School.

So how do the two compare for the non-technical? Would I recommend them?

Broadly speaking, both were good experiences; both teach a lot of new concepts and practical skills while helping you transition into a new career. But if you're not technical or don't have business experience, I don't think I would recommend going to Product School. A bootcamp however is worth it no matter your background. So what's the difference?

It comes down to the job market. Just about every job posting for product management that I see wants engineering, business, or product management experience. While Product School's curriculum is good, I don't think it will make up for that gap.

Most of the value I got from Product School was reframing my engineering experience. I saw how a lot of what I had done relates to product management and in some cases was product management by another name. Many of the opaque elements of product management I had been exposed to in my engineering capacity were clarified.

Without my engineering experience, a lot of Product School's curriculum would have just been slides in a presentation, another concept to memorize or study. The practical understanding would be missing, and without that, I'm not sure how valuable that information would be. For that reason, I really wouldn't recommend Product School to someone without related experience. I just don't think it would work out.

A coding bootcamp though would be worth it because a bootcamp really can take you from non-technical to a web developer. I know that for a fact because it did for me.

Additionally, even if you don't land a job right out of a bootcamp, you can build projects, contribute to open source, or do volunteer development until you accrue enough experience to land your first job. That's what I did. It works.

So if you have relevant experience or are confident you can hustle hard enough to make up for a lack of experience, I do recommend Product School. 

But if you're a complete newcomer to tech, try a coding bootcamp first.
