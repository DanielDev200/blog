Switching to product management, I've decided to be a beta user for products and write about my experiences with them. This is the first review.

I was contacted by the creator of Unified Awareness (UA), a weekly newsletter that focuses on global social justice, and was asked if I'd be interested in being a beta tester.

I was interested, so I went to <https://unifiedawareness.landen.co/> to sign up. The design is...okay. I don't have much weight as a designer so I won't get into it too much, but it's not difficult to see the design is very basic.

However, considering my experience writing, I am qualified to speak on the website copy, and there are some issues.

The hero text reads "Become Aware in Just 7 minutes", but I'm not sure what this means. Become aware of what? Why 7 minutes? Its vague and does not speak to the problem it is solving. Had I visited UA's page as a regular guest and not someone with a keen interest in reviewing products, I probably would have left.

But, I signed up. And here there was a large UX flaw. Rather then being shown a success message with next steps, the join button turned green and then quickly reverted to its prior state. The screen shot is below.

To me, that to be a pretty big issue. As a user, I should know what to do next - probably check my email. And the button reverting state is very confusing. Did the signup work? I assumed so, but had to check to be sure.

I navigated to my email, and sure enough there was a success email that told me I had signed up and my first newsletter would come on Friday. But that day was Tuesday, so I had to wait **three days** before I would get the news. This is another missed opportunity. As a user that has just signed up for a new service, I want the value now, not in three days.

When the email did arrive, I thought it was actually quite good. It's irreverent and does a good job of broadly touching on many issues. It's odd to me that UA's website doesn't speak to the tongue-in-cheek tone the newsletter takes. And the "7 minute" hook isn't in the newsletter at all, so there is some confusing brand messaging.

Were I a product manager for UA, I would
