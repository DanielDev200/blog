As part of my transition to product management, I've decided to be a beta user for products and write about my experiences with them. This is the first review.

The creator of Unified Awareness (UA), a weekly newsletter that focuses on global social justice, contacted me and asked if I'd be interested in being a beta tester.

I was interested, so I went to <https://unifiedawareness.landen.co/> to sign up. The design is...okay. I don't have too much credibility as a designer so I won't go deep, but it's not difficult to see the design is very basic.

But as a former journalist and freelance writer, I am qualified to speak on the site's copy, and there are some issues.

The hero text reads "Become Aware in Just 7 minutes", but I'm not sure what this means. Become aware of what? Why 7 minutes? It's vague and does not speak to the problem it is solving. Had I visited UA's page as a regular guest and not someone with a keen interest in reviewing products, I probably would have left.

But I signed up, and here I found a large UX flaw. Rather than being shown a success message with the next step, the join button turned green and then quickly reverted to its prior state. The screenshot is below.

That is a pretty big issue. As a user, I should know what to do next - probably check my email. But I'm not told and anything and then the button reverts state. Did the signup work? I assumed so but had to check to be sure.

I navigated to my email and sure enough, there was a success email. Hooray! But the email said my first newsletter would not come until Friday meaning I would have to wait **three days**...boo! This is another missed opportunity. As a user that has just signed up for a new service, I want the value now, not in three days. UA should send last Friday's newsletter with the confirmation email instead of a message saying the user has to wait.

When the email did arrive, I thought it was actually quite good. It's irreverent and does a good job of broadly touching on many issues. It's odd to me that UA's website doesn't speak to the tongue-in-cheek tone the newsletter takes. And the "7 minute" hook isn't in the newsletter at all, so what's that about?

If I was a product manager for UA, I would recommend dropping the 7 minute claim. It serves no purpose and frames the newsletter as a get-new-quick service when from my perspective it isn't. Additionally, the irreverent tone should be reflected on the product's website. Finally, I would be curious to see how many signups and how many actually open the email. My suspicion is the poor website messaging plus delayed delivery of the newsletter is hurting user engagement.
