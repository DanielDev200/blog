As part of my transition into product management, I will be attending product management related events Monday through Thursday. But today, rather than decide on one, I attended two.

An interesting thing about these events is that neither were hosted in the US; one was broadcast from London, the other from Australia. It's very cool that in 2020 I can learn with people from all around the world, each from the privacy of our homes. Product management is a global community.

Up first, "Minimum Viable Product".

I know what an MVP is, so I didn't expect to learn too much from this talk. That assumption was largely correct.

However this talk dad hammer one intricacy home - an MVP is for early adopters. Obvious, right? But I'm not sure I quite understood that dynamic entirely.

MVPs are not built to satisfy everyone. An MVP is built to satisfy early adopters and to validate a hypothesis. If an MVP isn't doing both of those, it will be difficult to accurately measure its performance, and the implications of that are huge. That is something I'll have to remember going forward.

Second, The Role of UX in The Business Ecosystem.

This was an incredible presentation and I took screenshots of many of the slides. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to share them here so I won't, but the following bullets are a few of the most salient points.

* As a product owner, know that the cost of getting it wrong is far greater than the cost of not having it on time.
* UX removes ambiguity and assumptions from the design process.
* UX uses qualitative and quantitative research to understand what the best experience is for the user.
* Competitor influence can push you from a logical mindset into a panic. Ask - what is your data telling you? Follow that. Look for quantitative trends.

What really struck me is the way the speaker differentiated between UX, UI, and product, and how he was so clearly able to separate the roles of each while explaining how they work together in a business setting. I will be reviewing these slides in the coming days.
