As part of my transition into product management, I am attending at least two product management related events each week and writing about what I learned. But today, to give this an exciting launch, I attended two events in **one day,** completing a stunning feat of intellectual endurance the likes of which are rarely seen.

Interestingly, neither of the talks were hosted in the US -  one was broadcast from London, the other from Australia. It's very cool that in 2020 I can up my PM skills with people from all around the world while wearing sweatpants in the comfort of my own home.

Up first, "Minimum Viable Product".

Going into the talk I believed I knew what an MVP was, so I didn't expect to learn too much. Thankfully my ignorance (arrogance?) was put in its place when the presenter beautifully married the basics of MVPs and user adoption to hone in on the fact that **MVPs are for innovators and early adopters**.

The focus on that convergence was an "Aha!" moment because I realized my siloed understanding of MVPs and user adoption had lead to an incomplete understanding of both. 

After this talk, I better understood that an MVP is built to satisfy both innovators and early adopters as well as validate a hypothesis. An MVP that isn't doing those things will be difficult to measure, and the implications of that are massive. 

Second, "The Role of UX in The Business Ecosystem".

It's possible that I was biased going into this talk because I was genuinely excited by the topic, but I feel like I learned a lot. I learned so much that I don't  believe it's all worth summarizing here, so let this bullet point list act a review of key learnings.

1. **UX removes ambiguity and assumptions from the design process**. This was informative in the context of "what's the difference between UX and UI design?". I now understand that real difference is data.
2. **UX uses qualitative and quantitative research to understand what the best experience is for the user.** I have worked with UX designers who seemed to miss this point. When acting as a PM, I will know to always ask for data when UX decisions are being made.
3. **As a PM, know that the cost of getting a product wrong is far greater than the cost of not delivering the product on time.** This point is more business related. Navigating the business needs of a company as a PM will be challenging, and I will have to remember that I can't let myself be swept up in a desire to go fast.
4. **Competitor influence can push you from a logical mindset into a panic.** This point was a fascinating insight into organizational psychology, namely how a competitor launch can be disruptive. The presenter recommended letting data guide you and searching for quantitative trends.

What really struck me is the way the speaker differentiated between UX, UI, and product, and how he was so clearly able to separate the roles of each while explaining how they work together in a business setting. I will be reviewing these slides in the coming days.
