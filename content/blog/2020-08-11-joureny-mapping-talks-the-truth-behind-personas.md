To say every persona I have worked with is garbage is a strong statement, maybe too strong to be truthful. But the reality isn't far off.

That's because most the personas I've used were no personas at all, but actually...**proto-personas!** What deception!

And I learned all this thanks to a by [UXPRESSIA](https://uxpressia.com/), "Journey Mapping Talks: The Truth Behind Personas".

I am embarrassed to admit that while I had not actually heard of a proto-persona before the talk, I immediately recognized what it is because I have worked with many in the past.

Open Practice Library defines a proto-persona as ["a description of the target users and audience of a product based on the assumptions of stakeholders."](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/proto-persona/)

Interestingly, in all [](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/proto-persona/)of the meetings I had with product team members, UX designers, and stakeholders, I hadn't heard the team either. So what gives?

It's possible that working in a B2B where account managers know users by name, crafting bulletproof personas just wasn't a priority. That makes enough sense, but I can think back on failed product launches and see how understanding that we were working with proto-personas and not actual persona could have shifted perspective and allowed for much needed adjustments. 

As the presenter said, "proto-personas can create an echo chamber of assumptions". And that sounds familiar (familiar...familiar...) to me.

So what differentiates personas from proto-personas? The answer to that question is outside the scope of this article, but suffice to say, the it's data - qualitative and quantitative - and a specific, well-defined scenario the persona will be applied to.

UXPRESSIA offers affordable courses on crafting personas, and in the coming weeks I just might enroll in one to get a better grip on crafting great personas. But until then, at least I know how to spot a bad persona.
