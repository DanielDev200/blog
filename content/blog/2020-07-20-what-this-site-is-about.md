The odds that anyone will read this post are slim, so I'll keep it short.

This is my personal site that I will use to document my transition into product management. Becoming a product manager won't be easy, so I'll need a way to demonstrate that I'm serious. That's what this site is - proof that I mean it.

If I attend a lecture about product management, I'll post it. All the web development side projects I do will get a post as well. And design. And because I have a background in journalism and have a deep personal interest in how technology has changed journalism, some of that will appear here too.
