I just received word that I have been accepted into the DS4A program!



![You have been accepted in the DS4A program](/img/screen-shot-2020-09-14-at-4.36.24-pm.png "DS4A Acceptance Announcement")

DS4A is a 13-week data science training program that is taught by professors from top universities and has a curriculum designed in collaboration with data-intensive organizations.

To say I'm excited about this opportunity is an understatement. 

When I look at where I'm at in my career and where I want to be, I can see that data literacy is one thing that is standing in my way. I have the communication skills and can craft the narratives. I have the engineering know how. With a third tool of data literacy and data analysis abilities, I know that I will be uniquely prepared to make meaningful progress in my professional pursuits.

I will miss my Friday nights and Saturday afternoons - session for me is from 7am to 5pm on Saturdays - but it will be worth it.
